Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 5. Tauri UI Debugging

**Use WDIO e2e for UI inspection and testing through the real Tauri application.**

Recommended workflow in this repo:
- Run `pnpm test:e2e`. It builds the native application with the e2e feature and launches it through `@wdio/tauri-service`.
- For iteration, add or update a focused spec under `e2e/`, then run that spec with `pnpm exec wdio run ./wdio.conf.ts --spec ./e2e/<name>.spec.ts`. The WDIO configuration builds the e2e application before starting the session.
- Use WDIO browser, element, and assertion APIs to inspect rendered state, exercise interactions, and wait for asynchronous updates.
- If the issue looks like loading, sync, or missing data, inspect the Tauri command path and Rust logs before blaming React.

Preferred WDIO usage:
- Prefer accessible, user-visible selectors and explicit WDIO waits over fixed sleeps.
- Assert the state before and after an interaction so the spec proves the reported behavior.
- Keep regression specs focused on the failing user flow and preserve them after the fix.
- Use WDIO logs and captured application output to distinguish UI state, Tauri invoke failures, and startup failures before changing code.

Known pitfalls to avoid:
- Do not assume `Data sync failed` or `Load failed` means the React code is broken. In this app it can mean a Tauri command, Rust scanner, app data path, or Codex log parsing failure.
- Do not substitute `pnpm dev` or browser-only automation for WDIO e2e when proving a Tauri UI bug; they do not exercise the native command path.
- Do not run another dev server on port `5273` while the e2e application is starting. Port conflicts can look like unrelated Tauri startup failures.
- In React dev mode, `StrictMode` re-runs effects. If startup logic lives in `useEffect`, guard against duplicate bootstrap requests and loading-state flicker.
- If data is already on screen, avoid replacing the whole view with a full-page loading card for background refreshes unless that behavior is explicitly desired.

## Git
After completing the task, if there are no issues, commit the changes to Git. Write by Conventional Commits style in English.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
